# Pandora Lite

An external ESP for Roblox made with the intent to be simple, have multi-game support, easy-to-use, performant, and stable.

By making this open source we want to not only help people learn game hacking, but to also receive contributions from the community to help reach our vision for this program, and create a good software made for everyone to be able to use.
